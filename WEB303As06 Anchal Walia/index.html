                    <p class="tab2-panel active" id="tab2-panel-1">Angrej (transl. Englishman) is a 2015 Indian Punjabi-language historical romance film directed by Simerjit Singh. Set against the backdrop of the waning British Raj, the film chronicles the love story of a young man and a woman, played by Amrinder Gill and Sargun Mehta respectively, belonging to different social strata. Angrej has Aditi Sharma, Ammy Virk, Binnu Dhillon, Anita Devgan, Sardar Sohi, and Nirmal Rishi in supporting roles; it marked the feature film debut for Mehta and Virk.

                        Conceived as a romantic comedy set in the pre-partitioned Punjab, Angrej's story was written by Amberdeep Singh, who had always wanted to work on a period film about Punjabi culture. The film was shot in the rural parts of Rajasthan and Punjab over 40 days, with Navneet Misser serving as the cinematographer. Production designer Raashid Rangrez paid particular attention to the film's sets and costumes as he wanted them to represent the Punjab of the 1940s accurately. Jatinder Shah composed the film's soundtrack, which features vocals from Gill, Virk and Sunidhi Chauhan.</p>
                    <p class="tab2-panel" id="tab2-panel-2">Pargat (Amrinder Gill) and Jessica (Sargun Mehta) are a couple who are going through a separation for various reasons. They together have a son named Manveer (Manvir Johal) who has his own set of problems in school, where he faces racism and discrimination issues. Manveer goes into deep depression and on the recommendation of the doctor, his parents decide to take him to Punjab to show his roots, culture and ancestral village. Jessica somehow convinces her father-in-law, Brar Sarpanch (Yograj Singh) to show Manveer that Punjab is better than Canada. Pargat, Jessica, and Manvir go to Punjab together for 15 days. Pargat and Jessica act like a happy couple, as Pargat's parents do not know about their impending divorce. After spending time with each other without any interference of work and grind of daily busy life, their love for each other is re-kindled, but they do not tell each other. Manveer is better and enjoying life again. They come back to Canada and get divorced. After the divorce, Jessica is set to get engaged to Zora, Jessica's childhood friend. Pargat realizes that he loves Jessica and can not live without her. At the engagement, Manvir steals the engagement ring but returns it. Pargat fakes a phone call from his father and Jessica finds out that they still don't know about divorce. Jessica realizes that Pargat was lying and goes outside, citing a network problem. Jessica later leaves her engagement, hops into her car and drives to their home. They have a small argument, and then Pargat confesses his love for her and they patch up. One year later, the couple has a baby girl and they plan to go to Punjab again. The film ends when Parget gets a phone call from his parents and he tells them they are coming to visit.</p>
                    <p class="tab2-panel" id="tab2-panel-3">Pamma is in his late thirties living in Canada with his sister and her family. He is doing petty jobs but doesn't carry on for very long as he has bad temper and lack of subordination. He is struggling to live and find a direction in his life in contrast from the Pamma from 15 years back, who was full of life and hope.

                        He was a passionate Bhangra dancer and was the star performer of Khalsa College, Amritsar. But things didn't work out the way he had hoped and after breaking ties with his college team, with the love of his life and his father, his sister gave him a sanctuary in her home as she loves him unconditionally.
                        
                        But now at an unexpected juncture his sister's kid Ekam finds out about his dance talent and the kids are in dire need of his help. This equation brings him closer to kids and his long-lost passion but also, he comes across his lost love/Jia, in a very vulnerable situation. Pamma finds the emotions he had covered up deep in his heart for all these years.</p>
